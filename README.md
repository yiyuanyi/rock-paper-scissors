# rock-paper-scissors
make rock, paper, scissors using JS for TOP

1)Relatively easy to make computerPlay(), however I am finding it very hard to make the playRound() function work.

2)May use switch statements for cases as this may be easier format than the if else statements.

3)Keep if else statements. Writing all statements so that is out of the way.
