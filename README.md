# rock-paper-scissors
make rock, paper, scissors using JS for TOP

Requires using loops, functions to convert font case, randomly selecting item from array, calling back to global functions.

Found this difficult but learnt a lot about correct order of code and also nesting.

Update!
Create rps that uses DOM manipulation and basic html/css UI interface to play the game
