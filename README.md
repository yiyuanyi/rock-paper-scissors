make rock, paper, scissors using JS for TOP

1)Relatively easy to make computerPlay(), however I am finding it very hard to make the playRound() function work.

2)May use switch statements for cases as this may be easier format than the if else statements.

3)Keep if else statements. Writing all statements so that is out of the way. Looking at other peoples TOp to try and get what to do next.

4)Have got it to work with manual input of playRound(rps1, rps2). would like it to run automatically with prompt and computerSelection using computerPlay().

5)Made it case insensitive by adding toLowerCase() inside the playRound() function.

6)Adding in loop to play 5 rounds of the game. Cannot get it to work right now. Think i need the playerSelection prompt and computerSelection to work properly. 

7)Have got playRound() to work using the player prompt and computerPlay(). Works fine now!!! nice
